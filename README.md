Automation testing for two web applications.

For the first one (https://demo.productionready.io/#/), Selenium and TestNG were used to test it.

For the second one (https://reqres.in/), pure Java and TestNG were used to do API testing.

In the end, after all tests are executed for the two web applications, an HTML report is generated which shows the details for each test.
